## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This is your BNTA assessment day mini project.

Challenges like the one you will complete today will help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

**To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML and CSS.**

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out a shop landing page which can be anything from a snacks shop, record shop or whatever excites you. You'll use the designs, code examples and what you've learned so far to guide you through the process but don't be afraid to google things along the way that you don't understand, it sounds silly but it's equally a very important skill to troubleshoot and research answers for your own projects.

Your users should be able to: 

- View the optimal layout for the desktop with responsive design

Stretch goal:
Your users should be able to:
- Add an item to their shopping basket.
- Remove an item from their shopping basket.
- See how many items are in their shopping basket.

To collaborate we advise using Live Share, an extension in VSCode. If you haven't installed Live Share already, don't worry, if you open VSCode you should see a panel on the left-hand side of your screen. Click the icon that looks a like four little cubes (you can hover your mouse over the icon and it should say extensions to check), in the search bar type live share and install live share by microsoft.

Want some support on the challenge? Mentors are on hand for support but we advise you to follow the process of brain, book, buddy, boss (in this case trainer) so that you give yourself a chance to have a go at the problem, then try to help each other and if you're still stuck, the mentors and trainer will be available to help.

## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project using the designs inside the `/design` folder as inspiration. You will find a desktop version of an example design to give you an idea of what you're aiming to create.

A `style-guide.md` file has also been included which includes a link to a figma design board that will help to give you a starting point. A link to a website where you can find stock images has also been included alongside a website which will help you decide on a colour palette for the colour scheme of your site. Further down there are also css attributes and small descriptions of what they can be used for to give you an idea of what to google when you are trying to accomplish a task relating to the design of your page.

You will find an example asset in the `/images` folder. This image has been referred to within the the img tags src attribute within the index.html starter template found in the src directory. This is so that you can see how to write the relative paths to access any images you store in this directory for use in your site. We recommend that you add your own image assets to the same folder and delete the image already there if you are not using it.

## Building your project

We have designed a workflow to guide you through the creation of your site. This can be found in the form of ordered tasks and coding tasks in the trello board that has been distributed to you (don't forget to click on the cards for extra information):

The workflow looks something like this:

1. Download the files from this github: in the form of a zip.
2. Look through the design example to get an idea of how you'll tackle the project. This step is crucial to help you think ahead for CSS classes to create reusable styles e.g. are there any parts of your website that will be styled the same.
3. Begin working through the tasks on the trello board, moving the tasks across the board as you complete them. You will first create the html for a feature of your website beforing adding the css, working from the top of the page down. Only move on to the next section once you're happy you've completed the area you're working on.

### Useful resources

- [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - W3Schools is best used as a reference for HTML, CSS and JavaScript to search syntax and functionality.
- [MDN Web Docs](https://www.example.com) - The MDN Web Docs site provides information about HTML, CSS and JavaScript. You may find MDN explanations more helpful in trying to understand what you're currently working with at that time.

## Deploying your project

As mentioned above, there are many ways to host your project for free. If you would like to host your website after the assessment day then you can checkout using our recommended host but we must stress that this is not a requirement of the assessment day and we advise this is left till after the assessment for any that are interested.

- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)

## Create a custom `README.md`

We strongly recommend overwriting this `README.md` with a custom one. We've provided a template inside the [`README-template.md`](./README-template.md) file in this starter code.

The template provides a guide for what to add. A custom `README` will help you explain your project and reflect on your learnings. Please feel free to edit our template as much as you like.

Once you've added your information to the template, delete this file and rename the `README-template.md` file to `README.md`. That will make it show up as your repository's README file.

## Submitting your solution

Submit your solution 

Once you've collected all your work in to one folder and checked that it works, please zip your files and send to:  where are we sending? -> upload link

## Got feedback for us?

We love receiving feedback! We're always looking to improve our challenges and our processes. So if you have anything you'd like to mention, please add it to the assessment day survey that we will be sending out in a couple of weeks to you.

**Have fun building!** ðŸš€
